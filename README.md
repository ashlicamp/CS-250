**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs generally requires finding out three things: the type of user, what they want to do, and the reason they want to do it. This information received from the customer is then used to create user stories, which helps organize the project requirements that can be sectioned off into sprints for the development team to work on. 

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

 Maintaining flexibility and being ready for inevitable curveballs is a major plus of the agile approach. Working in sprints and meeting frequently and consistently with the development team helps keep the project on track and makes it easy to adjust planning.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member actively participates, fulfills their obligations to the team, and listens to their other team members. It’s important to let each individual team member know that they are valued, and to ask for support or advice when needed.
